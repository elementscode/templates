@elements/templates
===================

Global templates used by the elements create command.

Templates let you create projects and project resources from default files and
folder structures. These templates are installed globally with this package when
you install elements.

You can find these templates in `~/elements/node_modules/@elements/templates/src`.
And you can override default global templates by copying the template folder
into the `~/elements/config/user/templates` folder and updating the source code
for the template. You can also create brand new templates. Look at the default
templates for examples.

You can override or create new templates at the project level by putting
templates into the `config/templates` folder of the project.
