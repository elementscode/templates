@elements/templates
===================

These are the default templates used by the `elements create` command to create
projects and project resources. These templates are installed when elements is
installed. You can override templates globally or at the project level.

To override global templates copy the template from this **src** folder into
**~/elements/config/user/templates** folder. You can also create new templates
in this folder to make them globally accessible.

To override or create project specific templates, update or create the template
in the project's **config/templates** folder.

To see how to create a template look at **src/app/index.js** in this project.
